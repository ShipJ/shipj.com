#### About me

I'm a Data Scientist x Engineer, focused on solving company needs: optimising data-stacks, deriving value from data, and shipping scalable data products. 

Whether it's revenue-generation or cost-saving, I've led teams on large-scale projects spanning computer‑vision, classification, search, fraud detection, churn prediction, time-series forecasting, and data migrations.

The dream is to run my own consulting gig, so I began the journey of what that might look like - [can I help you!?](..)

#### Professional life

I never thought I'd become a *Trend Forecaster* and after 8 years with WGSN, I'm still figuring it out.

I most recently led the Data Science and Engineering teams at the world's leading trend authority, transforming it from publishing house -> data-driven powerhouse. I don't say that lightly and explain what I mean [here]().

**Leadership style**

I align most closely with [servant leadership](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/management-styles/) because its the fastest way to achieve the multiplier effect.

Every manager I've ever had has told me to *choose* between managerial and technical pathways - but I don't see it as a binary choice. We've all seen the career chart showing this inevitable divergence, and with it, the loss of talented engineers to better pay yet, and exceptional leaders to technical shoehorning.

I've spent the best part of 10 years proving that this doesn't have to be the case. The best leaders insist on being hands‑on, leadubg from the front, 

However, you can only do this by honing the fundamentals, getting the basics right, and not getting complacent. 

**Preferred tools**
- Cloud-agnostic but prefer <u>GCP</u> and <u>AWS</u>
- <u>BigQuery</u> and <u>Snowflake</u> for data-warehousing (started with <u>SQL Server</u>)
- <u>dbt</u> for transformations
- <u>Looker</u> for its semantic layer and governed BI (started with <u>Tableau</u>)
- <u>Python</u> and <u>SQL</u>

#### Side projects

**Personal website**

*This website* is a side project! I've always wanted to create my own site to substantiate my claim as a bona fide computer scientist, but never found the time... until [I was made redundant]()!

It contains thoughts, blog posts, tutorials, and a [portfolio](../portfolio/) of professional projects spanning [Data Science](../categories/data-science), [Engineering](../categories/data-engineering), and [Analytics](../categories/data-analytics).

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) made creating the site straightforward, although I know nothing about web development. I've spent *far* more time adding unnecessary features than content - have you seen the banner? 😅
