## Overview

The Migrate to Looker project centralized business reporting and analytics, enabling 200+ users to access insights through 100+ dashboards powered by dbt and Looker.

I led the migration from legacy reporting solutions, built automation scripts via Looker API, and developed supporting tools in Excel and Google Sheets to enhance accessibility and manage complex reporting flows.

Core Technologies and Approach

BI Migration & Dashboarding:

Migrated all business reporting flows into Looker and dbt, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual effort.

Created 100+ dashboards for different teams, enabling self-service analytics and reducing ad-hoc reporting requests.

Automated 10+ Analysis Packs referenced in monthly board meetings, streamlining executive reporting.

Automation & Tools:

Developed Python scripts to manage Looker workflows via API, including scheduling, content updates, and dashboard management.

Built a complementary Business Intelligence suite in Excel and Google Sheets for offline reporting and specialized calculations.

Integrated BigQuery and Snowflake as backend warehouses, ensuring scalable and reliable data pipelines.
