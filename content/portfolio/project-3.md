## Project Overview

<u>VISION</u> is an image recognition pipeline designed to accelerate taxonomy classification by combining classical statistical approaches with cutting-edge neural networks and LLM techniques. The system bridges traditional manual labeling methods with automated deep learning, enabling scalable, accurate, and rapid image classification for client deliverables.

I led the design, prototyping, and implementation of the pipeline, delivering production-ready models that now form a core part of large-scale workflows.

### Technologies and Approach

**Hybrid Modeling & Taxonomisation:**

- Combined traditional forecasting methods (ARIMA) with neural networks and LLM-assisted approaches to enable one-shot taxonomisation of image datasets.
- Optimised labeling and data selection to maximize model accuracy, ensuring neural networks could learn effectively from limited examples.

**Data & Model Engineering:**

- Partnered with traditional image labeling teams to transition manual expertise into custom PyTorch models, improving both speed and dataset targeting.
- Built a prototype image blurrer and classifier in Python using Ultralytics’ YOLOv8, streamlining preprocessing and detection.
- Implemented feedback loops to continuously enhance model accuracy and reliability in production workflows.

**Productionisation & Workflow Integration:**

- Models are now embedded into client-facing deliverables, supporting large-scale automation of image classification tasks.
- Designed the system for scalability, enabling teams to process thousands of images with minimal manual intervention.
  (Consider adding diagrams of model workflow, before/after examples of images, or a snippet of the YOLOv8 pipeline.)

### Team Enablement & Process Optimisation

- Trained labeling teams on dataset targeting and annotation best practices, enhancing data quality for neural network training.
- Documented pipelines and modeling strategies to accelerate adoption across engineering and insights teams.
- Introduced iterative prototyping workflows to quickly test new architectures and preprocessing techniques.

### Impact & Outcomes

- Faster taxonomy classification: Reduced manual labeling time while improving accuracy.
- Production-ready deep learning models: YOLOv8 pipeline now integrated into core client workflows.
- Hybrid modeling efficiency: Combining classical and neural methods enhanced one-shot classification performance.
- Team upskilling: Traditional teams now empowered to contribute directly to model development and refinement.
  (Optionally include metrics like “X% faster labeling” or “Y images classified per hour” for added impact.)

### Future Expansion

Potential next steps include:

- Scaling LLM-assisted image annotation for even faster dataset expansion.
- Exploring transformer-based vision models for more complex classification tasks.
- Integrating real-time detection and alerting, allowing clients to act instantly on image-based insights.
