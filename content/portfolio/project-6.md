## Project Overview
The Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) project enabled high-quality, reliable data delivery to multiple enterprise clients, supporting both reporting and advanced analytics. I led the end-to-end design and execution of this service, securing multi-year client commitments worth £500k+, and collaborated with globally distributed teams to ensure seamless delivery. Beyond core data pipelines, the project evolved to include forecasting data, expanding its strategic value for clients.

### Technologies and Approach

**Data Pipeline & Engineering:**

- Built and maintained scalable Snowflake pipelines, orchestrated and version-controlled with dbt.
- Designed automated testing and monitoring frameworks to validate data integrity and pipeline health.
- Developed comprehensive data dictionaries to standardize definitions across clients and internal teams.

**Service Level Agreements & Client Delivery:**

- Defined SLAs and build requirements aligned with client expectations, ensuring timely and accurate data delivery.
- Coordinated with distributed client teams to gather requirements, implement feedback, and adapt pipelines to evolving business needs.
- Integrated forecasting datasets into DaaS outputs, adding strategic analytical value.
  (Optional: diagram showing data ingestion → dbt transformations → Snowflake → client delivery & monitoring.)

### Team Enablement & Workflow Optimization

- Implemented automation for testing and monitoring, reducing manual validation and minimizing errors.
- Produced documentation and onboarding materials for clients and internal stakeholders.
- Shared best practices for pipeline design and monitoring across the engineering team.

### Impact & Outcomes

- £500k+ in multi-year client commitments secured through reliable data delivery.
- Improved pipeline reliability and efficiency through automation and monitoring.
- Expanded analytical value by including forecasting outputs in client datasets.
- Enabled global client teams to confidently consume and act on high-quality data.

### Future Expansion

- Potential enhancements include:
- Extending pipelines to real-time or streaming data for more responsive analytics.
- Adding advanced self-service capabilities for clients to query and visualize data directly.
- Incorporating data lineage and provenance tracking for regulatory compliance and audit readiness.
- Exploring predictive SLAs using ML to proactively detect and prevent pipeline issues.
