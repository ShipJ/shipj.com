## Project Overview

["TrendCurve AI"](https://www.wgsn.com/en/trading/fashion-buying) is the culmination of WGSN's first step into data-driven forecasting - a product designed to anticipate consumer trends using time-series modeling, deep learning, and hierarchical data structures across a range of proprietary datasets.

{{< note title="Thoughts on this section" >}}
I initially tried a grid layout, but a flexbox approach was more flexible for mobile.
{{< /note >}}

As the lead data scientist and engineer, I architected the systems and frameworks that transformed early prototypes into a production-grade forecasting engine, sold to hundreds of clients. This arduous process validated the long-term value of data-led insights in trend intelligence.

<br>

### Technologies and Approach

**Classical vs. Modern Approaches:** leveraged [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) by Meta in early iterations, then transitioned to Hierarchical Forecasting to improve top-down and bottom-up accuracy across product categories and regions.

**Deep Learning Expansion:** Implemented LSTM and Transformer architectures for multi-step forecasting and cross-series correlation learning, improving robustness to seasonality and sparse signals.

**Feature Engineering & Drift Monitoring:** Maintained over 90% predictive accuracy through continuous feature pipeline optimization and proactive drift detection in model performance.

<br>

### Engineering Foundations

- Built a modular data pipeline supporting real-time ingestion, transformation, and feature computation.
- Established CI/CD workflows for model retraining and deployment, integrating drift alerts and performance dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.
- Developed API endpoints and documentation for seamless integration into WGSN’s client platforms.

### Team Enablement, R&D & Leadership

Beyond technical delivery, I focused on building capability and sustaining innovation:

- Upskilled 10+ non-technical team members to manage and interpret data-heavy workflows confidently.
- Founded an internal <u>Research Hub</u>, coordinating R&D into scalable forecast automation, hierarchical modeling, and transformer-based architectures.
- Secured cross-functional buy-in by aligning data science outputs with design, editorial, and commercial teams.

(You can expand here with examples of training materials, internal workshops, or metrics showing adoption.)

### Impact & Outcomes

Test

- £3m+ annual recurring revenue directly attributable to the TrendCurve AI product line.
- > 90% model accuracy maintained over production lifecycle.
- Reduced manual workload by automating insight generation, freeing editorial teams for strategic analysis.
- Created a sustainable R&D pipeline, enabling continuous improvement and innovation in WGSN’s forecasting capabilities.
  (Optionally add visuals like before/after process charts or KPI dashboards.)

### Future Expansion

test

- The foundation laid by TrendCurve AI opens several avenues for future development:
- Integrating multimodal models combining text, image, and time-series data.
- Deploying explainability frameworks (SHAP, LIME) to enhance stakeholder trust.
- Exploring real-time trend nowcasting powered by transformer encoders and diffusion-based architectures.
