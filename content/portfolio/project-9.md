## Overview

The Monitoring & Alerting project improved transparency, reliability, and usability of data pipelines by implementing dbt and Looker’s semantic layer.

I led the rollout across BigQuery and Snowflake, enabling analysts and engineers to explore data lineage, understand transformations, and access comprehensive documentation, while building a culture of data literacy through ongoing training and community engagement.

Core Technologies and Approach

Data Observability & Lineage:

Implemented dbt models to capture dependencies, transformations, and metrics across pipelines.

Leveraged Looker’s semantic layer to surface lineage, definitions, and dashboards for easier exploration and auditing.

Designed automated documentation workflows to keep lineage and metadata up to date across multiple environments.

Team Enablement & Training:

Conducted training sessions to upskill engineers and analysts in dbt, Looker, and data observability concepts.

Hosted monthly ‘coffee hour’ sessions to share tips, encourage best practices, and address questions about pipelines, monitoring, and alerting.

Encouraged cross-team adoption of lineage-first thinking, improving data quality awareness and self-service analytics.

Impact & Outcomes

Improved data transparency and trust, enabling users to explore lineage and definitions easily.

Upskilled analysts and engineers, fostering self-sufficiency and curiosity about pipeline reliability.

Established a community of practice through regular knowledge-sharing sessions.

Reduced dependency on ad-hoc support for pipeline questions and troubleshooting.

Future Expansion

Potential next steps include:

Extending alerting to data quality issues, enabling proactive detection of anomalies.

Integrating automated SLA reporting to monitor critical pipeline performance.

Expanding documentation and lineage coverage to include forecasting and ML pipelines.

Developing interactive workshops for deeper hands-on training and certification within the team.
