## Overview

The Acquisition & Sale project focused on enabling a seamless data-driven transition during WGSN’s strategic sale.

I led migrations of key BI and data science tools, supported due diligence with high-quality extracts, and implemented data hygiene processes that enhanced Salesforce and other business-critical datasets. This ensured stakeholders had accurate, reliable, and actionable data throughout the acquisition process.

Core Technologies and Approach

Data Migration & Tool Integration:

Migrated core systems including Jira, Git, Looker, GCP, Databricks, and Marketo to ensure continuity of BI and data operations.

Established Clean Rooms and secure data pipelines to facilitate safe sharing of sensitive information during due diligence.

Oversaw workflows to ensure smooth handoff to acquiring parties.

Due Diligence & Reporting:

Provided structured data extracts and reports to support financial, operational, and technical evaluation.

Coordinated across teams to verify accuracy and completeness, ensuring confidence in reported KPIs.

Data Hygiene & Enrichment:

Led a data cleaning program for Salesforce, enhancing records with business metadata to improve usability and accuracy.

Implemented validation checks and documentation to maintain data quality post-migration.
