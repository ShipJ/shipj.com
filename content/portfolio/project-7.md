## Project Overview
The Finance Migration project modernized financial reporting by moving 60+ reports from AccessDB to BigQuery and dbt, automating previously manual processes and making reporting more reliable, scalable, and accessible. I led the migration, automation, and validation of finance reporting pipelines, enabling teams to focus on analysis rather than repetitive data preparation. Reports were deployed in Looker, replacing Excel-based workflows and providing a unified view of financial performance for internal teams and shareholders.

### Technologies and Approach
**Migration & Automation:**
- Extracted, transformed, and loaded finance data from AccessDB to BigQuery, building automated dbt models to standardize and transform reporting datasets.
- Sunsetted legacy reports and software, ensuring smooth transition without business disruption.
- Automated repetitive reporting tasks, saving over one week per month for Finance and Data teams.

**Reporting & BI:**
- Delivered reports in Looker, providing interactive dashboards and self-service access for Finance teams.
- Maintained accuracy and compliance for month-end reporting, shared internally and with shareholders.
- Standardized reporting metrics and definitions to ensure consistency across datasets and dashboards.

### Team Enablement & Workflow Optimisation
- Trained Finance team members on Looker dashboards and self-service capabilities.
- Documented data lineage and transformations to support auditing and governance requirements.
- Worked closely with Finance and Data teams to identify process improvements and validate migrated reports.

<br>

### Impact & Outcomes
- Saved 1+ week per month for Finance and Data teams through automation.
- Improved reliability and accessibility of financial reports.
- Enabled self-service reporting with Looker dashboards, reducing dependency on manual Excel workflows.
- Built internal expertise in cloud finance data pipelines, bridging Finance and Data teams.

### Future Expansion
Potential next steps include:
- Implementing predictive financial analytics leveraging historical data for forecasting.
- Adding automated variance and anomaly detection to highlight unusual trends.
- Integrating real-time dashboards for operational finance visibility.
- Expanding Looker dashboards to support scenario modeling and stakeholder reporting.
