## Project Overview
The Recommendations project aimed to deliver personalised content and product suggestions to website users, enhancing engagement and driving measurable business outcomes.
- I built an in-house recommendation engine on GCP and BigQuery, later transitioning to AWS Personalize for a production-ready, scalable solution fully integrated with the website. Beyond direct personalization, the project identified opportunities to merge recommendations into marketing bulletins, further amplifying user engagement and traffic.

### Technologies and Approach
**Data & Modeling:**
- Developed in-house collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation pipelines using BigQuery and GCP.
- Built preprocessing workflows to aggregate user behavior, content metadata, and interaction logs into structured inputs for recommendation algorithms.
- Implemented AWS Personalize to scale recommendations, enabling near real-time personalization on the website.

**Integration & Automation:**
- Designed APIs to serve recommendations directly to the website and marketing platforms.
- Automated data ingestion, model retraining, and deployment pipelines to ensure high-quality, up-to-date suggestions.
- Integrated recommendation outputs into marketing bulletins, turning algorithmic insights into actionable engagement strategies.

### Impact & Outcomes**
- 10% uplift in newsletter-derived traffic by incorporating personalized recommendations into bulletins.
- 5% increase in site engagement from tailored website suggestions.
- Scalable personalization infrastructure with AWS Personalize, reducing manual oversight and enabling continuous improvement.
- Cross-functional impact: Marketing, content, and product teams now leverage real-time insights for strategy and content planning.

### Team Enablement & Workflow Optimisation
- Documented processes and APIs to allow marketing teams to configure recommendation rules without engineering support.
- Established monitoring and retraining pipelines to maintain recommendation relevance over time.
- Shared insights with stakeholders to drive data-informed decisions in content placement and campaign design.

### Future Expansion
Potential next steps include:
- Integrating multimodal recommendations (images, video, text) to enhance personalization.
- Using reinforcement learning for adaptive, context-aware suggestions.
- Extending recommendations to push notifications or in-app messaging for omni-channel engagement.
- Incorporating causal attribution analysis to quantify recommendation-driven conversions more precisely.
