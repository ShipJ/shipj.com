## Overview

The Establish Databricks project transformed TrendCurve AI’s forecasting infrastructure from local Python scripts to a fully distributed platform, enabling massive scale, automated workflows, and centralized model management.

By leveraging Databricks, Spark, MLFlow, and Hyperopt, I made it possible for any team member to build, schedule, and monitor models, while maintaining robust performance tracking, drift monitoring, and reproducibility.

Core Technologies and Approach

Scalable ML & Forecasting:

Transitioned TrendCurve AI model builds to Databricks, scaling capacity 100x using distributed computing.

Implemented parallelized model training and hyperparameter tuning via Spark + Hyperopt, reducing computation time and enabling large-scale experimentation.

Integrated MLFlow for centralized model tracking, drift monitoring, and efficacy evaluation, providing transparency and reproducibility across teams.

Engineering & Workflow Enablement:

Designed workflows allowing any business user to run models on scheduled intervals, without needing local compute resources.

Established automated logging and monitoring to track performance, detect drift, and generate alerts.

Collaborated with internal teams to ensure workflows aligned with business needs and existing TrendCurve AI infrastructure.

Supplier & Cost Management:

Managed Databricks supplier relationship, including cost optimization, utilization tracking, and evaluation of new features for future adoption.

Team Enablement & Workflow Optimization

Enabled non-technical stakeholders to execute and monitor models independently, democratizing forecasting.

Documented workflows, dashboards, and best practices for cross-team adoption.

Provided guidance on resource allocation and cost management to ensure sustainable scaling.

Impact & Outcomes

100x scaling of forecast model builds, reducing bottlenecks and compute constraints.

Centralized tracking and monitoring with MLFlow, increasing transparency and model reliability.

Automated scheduling and execution, empowering business teams to generate insights independently.

Improved supplier cost and utilization efficiency, aligning platform capabilities with business value.

Future Expansion

Potential next steps include:

Integrating real-time data pipelines for live forecast updates.

Expanding hyperparameter optimization strategies with advanced distributed search methods.

Incorporating alerting and auto-retraining triggers for drift or anomalies.

Exploring cross-product forecasting using shared datasets for multi-domain predictions.
