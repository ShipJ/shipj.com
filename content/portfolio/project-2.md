## Project Overview

The Social Media Dashboard is a fully automated pipeline transforming raw social media signals into actionable insights for clients. By combining data engineering best practices with cutting-edge NLP, the platform identifies emerging trends across multiple channels, delivering them through a live, interactive dashboard.

As the lead on this project, I designed a robust architecture that enables continuous ingestion, transformation, analysis, and visualization of social media data, making trend detection faster, more accurate, and highly scalable.

### Technologies and Approach

**Data Pipeline & Engineering**

- APIs & Snowflake Integration: Built an automated ingestion layer that pulls live data from multiple social media platforms and stores it in Snowflake.
- dbt Transformations: Standardized and transformed raw social media data into analytics-ready tables, enabling consistent and reproducible workflows.
- Automation: End-to-end orchestration ensures near real-time updates to the dashboard without manual intervention.

**NLP & Analytics**

- Topic Modeling with BERTopic: Extracted meaningful topics and clusters from large volumes of unstructured text, allowing clients to quickly identify trending themes and conversations.
- NLP Pipelines: Preprocessed data with tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment scoring to enrich analysis and improve topic coherence.

**Visualisation & Dashboarding:**

- Developed a live, interactive dashboard that allows clients to explore emerging trends, topic clusters, and sentiment across time.
- Implemented user-friendly filters, drill-downs, and alerting mechanisms to highlight significant shifts in conversation or engagement metrics.

(You can include a screenshot or mockup of the dashboard here.)

### Team Enablement & Workflow Optimisation

- Designed the pipeline to be operable by non-technical stakeholders, allowing marketing and insights teams to query and interpret social media trends independently.
- Provided documentation and training on using the dashboard, understanding NLP outputs, and interpreting topic clusters.
- Set up monitoring and error handling to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime.

### Impact & Outcomes

- Faster trend detection: Real-time insights allow clients to react promptly to emerging conversations.
- Scalable automation: Reduced manual data collection and analysis, saving significant staff hours.
- Actionable intelligence: BERTopic clusters provide clear, digestible insights into audience interests and emerging narratives.
- Cross-functional adoption: Dashboard now used by marketing, product, and insights teams to guide strategic decisions.

(Optionally, you could add metrics like “X% faster insights” or “Y topics surfaced per week” to quantify impact.)

### Future Expansion\*\*

Potential next steps include:

- Integrating multimodal data (images, videos) for richer topic modeling.
- Deploying advanced NLP techniques such as transformers for contextual trend prediction.
- Adding predictive alerting to flag rising topics before they peak.

(Leave space for your reflections, planned enhancements, or client success stories.)
