## Overview

The Churn & Fraud Models project delivered actionable insights by detecting anomalies and potential churn, helping the business identify upsell opportunities while reducing reliance on costly third-party solutions.

I developed in-house decision tree-based models to replace an ineffective third-party service, generating measurable revenue and cost savings while adding flexibility for future enhancements.

Core Technologies and Approach

Anomaly Detection & Modeling:

Built churn and fraud detection models using decision trees on GCP and BigQuery, identifying patterns indicative of risk or opportunity.

Designed anomaly detection pipelines to highlight potential upsell opportunities or suspicious activity.

Replaced an existing 3rd-party solution with an in-house workflow, ensuring full control over modeling and flexibility for iteration.

Integration & Workflow:

Developed automated processes to feed anomalies and predictions into CRM and sales workflows, enabling immediate action.

Built dashboards and alerts for stakeholders to monitor results and track model effectiveness over time.

(Optional diagram: data ingestion → BigQuery → anomaly detection → dashboard / sales action.)

Impact & Outcomes

20+ upsell opportunities identified, converting to £200k in revenue.

£150k cost savings by replacing an ineffective third-party provider.

Added flexibility and control for model refinement and scaling.

Enabled data-driven decision-making for sales, finance, and risk teams.

Future Expansion

Potential next steps include:

Integrating real-time detection to flag anomalies immediately.

Expanding models to incorporate behavioral and transactional data for higher predictive accuracy.

Adding explainability tools to clarify model decisions for non-technical stakeholders.

Exploring reinforcement learning or ensemble methods to improve detection performance over time.

(Leave space for reflections, lessons learned, or planned enhancements.)
