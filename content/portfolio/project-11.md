## Overview

The Content Optimisation project focused on improving reader engagement and completion rates for WGSN content through data-driven experimentation and predictive modeling.

I collaborated with publishing teams to design and execute A/B tests that informed optimal release cadence, titles, and blurbs, ultimately shaping a more engaging content delivery strategy. This work supported a fundamental shift from long-form reports to dynamic, interactive pages.

Core Technologies and Approach

Experimental Design & Modeling:

Designed and implemented A/B tests in collaboration with publishing and editorial teams.

Built predictive models using DataRobot, leveraging decision trees and XGBoost to identify the features most correlated with engagement and completion.

Analyzed results to quantify the impact of content format, title, and blurb variations on reader behavior.

Content Strategy & Delivery:

Converted insights into actionable guidance for dynamic content generation and publishing workflows.

Recommended structural changes to reports and web pages, prioritizing formats and layouts that maximize user engagement.

Developed a framework to continuously monitor and refine content strategy based on engagement metrics.

(Optional diagram: A/B test flow → model analysis → insights → content adjustment → engagement metrics.)

Impact & Outcomes

Increased engagement and completion rates by optimizing title, blurb, and release strategy.

Enabled a shift to dynamic, page-based content, improving reader experience and retention.

Built a repeatable methodology for ongoing content experimentation and optimization.

Enhanced collaboration between data, publishing, and editorial teams, fostering a culture of experimentation.

Future Expansion

Potential next steps include:

Integrating personalization and recommendation models to tailor content to individual readers.

Expanding A/B testing to multimodal content (images, video, interactive elements).

Implementing real-time feedback loops to adapt content delivery based on live engagement.

Using ML explainability tools to understand the drivers of engagement for continuous optimization.
