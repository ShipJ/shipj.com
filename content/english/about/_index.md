I'd never have predicted that I'd become a trend forecaster. After eight years at the world's leading trend authority, I'm still figuring it all out. here I am squinting at patterns and trying to make sense of whatâ€™s next (with varying degrees of success).

This site is a place for things I care about â€” personal projects, half-formed ideas, essays I might regret later, and other stuff that doesnâ€™t quite fit into a corporate deck.

I offer light-touch consulting and tutoring services for businesses, teams, and individuals who want a fresh perspective on complex challenges â€” especially where culture, technology, and logic collide. If that sounds interesting, let's set up some time.

Outside of that, I like slow books, odd maps, and trying to learn things the hard way.

-- Uni Experience
I knew w I stepped into object-oriented programming, I didn't get it. How could anyone. I think I (vaguely) do now, but it wasn't for me. That taught me a lot about humility. I cared about relationships, ways of doing things quickly, cleverly. I listened in awe explaining bitwise operators a. After hours of thenewboston (whatever happened to Bucky Roberts?), KhanAcademy and using Wolfram Alpha to *help* with maths coursework.

-- Uni experience
UCL - research, what did I learn?

-- Jury service
Jury Service.. wow. Unqualified etc.

      }
