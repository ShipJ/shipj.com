It began at Ascential (WGSN's parent company), where I joined as its first Data Scientist in May 2017. My boss had left by the end of the year and I was left to fend for myself. 10+ acquisitions later, Ascential had positioned itself as. This is where I got my first experience of Looker, building it with Edge/Flywheel Devs.

At our annual conference, I was asked to join WGSN to . What had I done... Here I was, squinting at prints and patterns, trying to make sense of what gingham was as opposed to .

Outside of that, I like slow books, odd maps, and trying to learn things the hard way.

##### Redundancy

"My role" was made redundant in September 2025, and was the [greatest gift(s) I have ever received](../blog/post-2)

**TL;DR**

I don't take that likely, and know that others would baulk at me for saying it, but I was ready to pack it in. The thought of handing in my notice and reluctantly working for 3 months in a job I was not enjoying makes me quiver.

As a keen follower of personal finance and FIRE

It makes me ever more grateful for being _loyal_ - my partner insists that job-hopping is more fruitful, and she is probably right so I won't argue it. We are getting married in Australia in November, and the thought of

The final gift is my time back. Weekends, evenings, holidays, sickness were spent prepping 1-1 notes, monitoring pipelines, adding one extra feature, learning a new tool - getting the nth crazy project over the line because Y will be on annual leave from Wednesday.

In 8.5 years across WGSN and its parent company Ascential, I had never taken a sick day.

##### Skills

My skillset ranges from database management (cloud and on-prem) to data science workflows.

- **Languages**: python, SQL, javascript
- **Tools**: jfrwf
- **Soft**: Jira, Miro, Google Sheets

##### Management

I am a **servant-leader** and always will be. I hate _telling_ others how to do something. This probably didn't resonate with leaders around me, and would often be used against me "in your role, you should be \_\_\_\_".

I think this stems from being a technical leader - one who prefers to understand a technology before professing to use it. _Every_ manager I've ever had has told me I cannot be both - I must. Yet, my team of staff engineers and PhD-honed researchers compliment me for it. I've always found it to be a delicate balance. I am skeptical towards every shiny new tool, and really want to understand what problem it solves before implementing it.

I value appreciation culture and was often left frustrated at the lack of support despite (in my view) over-achieving.

It is a delicate balance between knowing that you are learning, and simply being taken advantage of. If there is one lesson I've learned - this was not worth it.

##### Transformation

At times I felt like a consultant, solving any data-related problem that came by my desk - from company acquisitions, to salesforce migrations, to churn models, to implementing new tools from scratch. The difference is not having an end-date.

I am responsible for transforming WGSN into a company that used Microsoft Access for Finance Reporting, Powerpoint and Excel, to supporting _every_ department.

##### Lessons from University

I knew as soon as , I didn't get it. How could anyone. I think I (vaguely) do now, but it wasn't for me. That taught me a lot about humility. I cared about relationships, ways of doing things quickly, cleverly. I listened in awe explaining bitwise operators a. After hours of thenewboston (whatever happened to Bucky Roberts?), KhanAcademy and using Wolfram Alpha to _help_ with maths coursework. I am very much a throw myself at the hardest problem kind of person, knowing that everyone around me is 100000x more intelligent.

##### Lessons from Jury service

Jury service taught me about imposter syndrome. I am not one to bullsh\* my way through conversations, and will always say when I don't know (or don't know enough) to form an opinion, but this was something else.

I have never felt so unqualified. My interpretation of 50+ pages of criminal law, and words by competing barristers, was the deciding factor of whether someone's life would change forever. But I did it and we had a beer afterwards.
